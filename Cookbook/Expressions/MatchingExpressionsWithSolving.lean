{index}[Pattern-matching by solving]

In the {ref "matching-expressions-exact-match"}[previous section], we saw how to match expressions by checking their structure. However, this method is brittle as Lean may, for example, reduce expressions or unfold definitions, causing the structure to change and the match to fail.

A more robust way to match expressions is to use Lean's *unification*. This is done by building an expression with _metavariables_ and using the `isDefEq` function to _solve_ for by unifying expressions. Here you should think of metavaiables like variables in mathematical equations (e.g., the variable `x` in the equation `2x+5=9`).



# Example : Inequalities between natural numbers

Suppose we want to inspect a goal to see if it is an inequality of the form `a ≤ b`, where a and b are natural numbers. If it is, we want to extract those values (to illustrate, we print these to the Infoview). Because this involves creating and assigning metavariables (temporary placeholders), we need to work inside the `MetaM` monad.

We will start by writing a function that takes an expression (`Expr`) as input. Its output will be an `Option (Expr × Expr)` wrapped inside the MetaM monad, allowing it to return the two sides of the inequality if a match is found, or none if it is not.

Therefore, the type signature of our function will be `Expr → MetaM (Option (Expr × Expr))`.

```lean
def matchNatLe? (e: Expr) :
    MetaM <| Option (Expr × Expr) := do
  let nat := mkConst ``Nat
  let a ← mkFreshExprMVar nat
  let b ← mkFreshExprMVar nat
  let ineq ← mkAppM ``Nat.le #[a, b]
  if (← isDefEq ineq e) then
    return some (a, b)
  else
    return none
```

`mkFreshExprMVar nat` constructs a metavariable of the type `nat`, where `nat` is an expression. This creates a blank hole that Lean can fill in later. The expression `isDefEq ineq e` checks whether the constructed expression ineq and the target expression e are definitionally equal. Crucially, as it checks for equality, it attempts to unify them by assigning concrete values from e to our blank metavariables a and b.

Now, to see this function in action we write an elaborator that fetches the main goal during the proof and passes it to `matchNatLe`.

```lean
elab "matchNatLe?" : tactic => do
  withMainContext do
  let goal ← getMainTarget
  match (← matchNatLe? (goal)) with
  | some (a, b) => logInfo m!"The goal is an inequality
    `a ≤ b` between natural numbers where a = {a}, b = {b}"
  | _ => logInfo m!"The goal is not an inequality"

example: 123 ≤ 234 := by
  matchNatLe?
  simp

```
