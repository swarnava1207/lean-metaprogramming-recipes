{index}[How to build a Recipe]

This chapter demonstrates the standard layout and features available for cookbook entries. Make sure to visit the website to see how the documentation is rendered and to get a better sense of how to structure your recipe.
You can use the template recipe  as a starting point.

# Adding Sections

Use the `#` symbol for top-level section like below. Each chapter should start with a clear problem statement and a summary of the solution. Just like `Introduction` here.

You can use `##` for subheaders to organize your content into sections. You can use `*` for a bolding - *Like this*.

# Formatting Text

## Adding inline Lean Code

You can include Lean code that is elaborated directly within the document. This is useful for small snippets.

```lean
def helloCookbook := "Welcome!"
```

## Errors and Warnings

Expected errors must be explicitly marked with `+error`. If the error message does not match exactly, the documentation build may fail.


## Cross-References

You can link to other sections using their tags: {ref "building-recipe"}[Back to top].

## Other Notes

You can add marginal notes like this.{margin}[Marginal notes are great for extra context.]
